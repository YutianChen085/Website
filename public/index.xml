      <description>Modeling Instructions A knitted R Markdown document (as a PDF) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on 5/1/2020. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., don’t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document). Knit an html copy too, for later! In the .Rmd file for Project 2, you can copy the first code-chunk into your project .</description>

      <description>Data Wrangling and Data Exploration Introduction: Two real-life datasets found for this project aim to illustrate whether there is a relation between life expentency and happiness level of the countries around the world. Both datasets are acquired from https://wwww.kaggle.com/datasets, and they interest me in the same way that they are comparing aspects of human on a world scale.
The first dataset named “Happy” is organized as a World Happiness Report of 2019.</description>
